# Tic Tac Toe Game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player strategy game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is for one player to align three of their symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal, while preventing the opponent from doing the same.

Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in one of the empty squares.
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line wins the game.
4. If all 9 squares are filled without either player achieving three in a row, the game ends in a draw
